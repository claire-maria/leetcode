2Sum:
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.


add two numbers:
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.


longest sub string
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.


3Sum:
Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.
Note:
The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.


Array Split Sum:
Split an array so that both arrays equal to the same number, or return that it is not possible

PairSum:
Find two values in an array which equal a given value

Triplets:
Same as PairSum, but with 3.
